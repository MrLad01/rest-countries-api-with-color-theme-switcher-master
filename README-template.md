## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) - For styles
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/instance) - for calling the API

### What I learned

In this project, I dedicated time to mastering responsive styling techniques, particularly through the implementation of React-Bootstrap, which was a new experience for me. I gained a deeper understanding of components and learned how to seamlessly integrate them into my projects. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge of API calls using axios.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out (https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/components) to learn more.

### Continued development

During this project, I actively prioritized the refinement of my TypeScript skills, dedicating focused effort towards mastering its intricacies and best practices. Through consistent practice and hands-on implementation, I've noted significant progress in my ability to write clean, efficient TypeScript code.

Moreover, I utilized this opportunity to delve deeper into styling techniques, ensuring that the user interface not only functions seamlessly but also delivers an aesthetically pleasing experience. By experimenting with various design principles and tools, such as React-Bootstrap, I've strengthened my understanding of responsive design and improved my ability to create visually appealing interfaces.

Overall, this project has served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to expand my skill set in both TypeScript development and styling, and I'm excited to continue building upon these foundations in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs) - This site served as a guide, helping me with how to apply the components into the project.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand responsiveness. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
